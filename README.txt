There are 3 files in this repository: 

1. The PDF file contains the merge sort tree from the assignment

2. I created the merge sort in javascript. I used node version 10.16
on my machine. To execute this code, all you need to do is install 
node version 10.16 and run the following command in terminal: 

node mergeSort.js 

3. I also attached a screen shot of the output for your reference

Please let me know if you cannot view it or if you have any questions

Thank you
